# Advanced-Encryption-Standard

- The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a specification for the encryption of electronic data established by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001.
- AES would take billions of years to break using current computing technology. In this project we implemented AES algorithm in verilog.
